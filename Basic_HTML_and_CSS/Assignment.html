			<h3> About Me </h3>
				<blockquote cite="https://sjphotos.net/about-1">For me, photography is about telling stories. I love going deeper with my subjects on why we are photographing a particular vision or idea. I don’t shoot purely based on aesthetics or trends. Each session is a manifestation of truth and meaning. I practice this by capturing genuine moments, providing an accurate representation of my subjects, and amplifying marginalized voices. I work to create a safe, honest, and loving environment for those I photograph. The end goal is to create positive change and bring more joy and compassion to the human experience. </blockquote>
